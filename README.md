# time-series-forecasting-energy
In this notebook I had my first look at creating sequences for time series forecasting using neural networks as part of a university assignment.
In the test case the model made predictions that were offset by several thousand GWh, however it did manage to capture general trends.
The data given felt a little underwhelming for the model in terms of variety, only having historic figures.
In future, I would not mind coming back to this project and work outside the assignment scope to provide more contextual country data such as GDP.
